# TFT_Randomizer

A simple node.js program running in electron that allows you to randomize your TFT cosmetics via LCU API calls. It uses the API to know all the cosmetics you currently own, and then randomly chooses between them. 

# Usage:

Download **tft-randomizer-1.0.0 Setup.exe** from releases, located directly to the right of this page. Only available for Windows at this time.

Run the executable which will install tft-randomizer to **C:\Users\\[User]\AppData\Local\tft_randomizer\tft_randomizer.exe**

Open the League Of Legends client and login; **you must have the client open & logged in before you open tft_randomizer.exe.**

Run tft_randomizer.exe or a shortcut to open up the program as seen here

Click the provided buttons to randomize Little Legend, Arena, or Boom (Or use the final button to randomize all of them at once!)

If the status text changes color as seen in the following image, the operation was successful and the change will be seen in your client within a couple seconds.

You can push each button as many times as you'd like, though after the first time the status text will just alternate between blue and green to show successful input, as seen below.
